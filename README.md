Developed machine learning models to predict property tax values for ~77,000 residential properties using structured Zillow data.
Applied data preprocessing, feature engineering (hot-encoding, imputation, normalization), and outlier removal to address high missingness and improve data quality.
Evaluated multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with repeated cross-validation and RMSE as the main metric.
Reported the findings using effective visualization techniques that are clearly understandable for both professional data scientists and non-technical personnel.
